# Vorare - Decentralized Simulation Platform

**Vorare** is a decentralized simulation platform for running dynamic, multi-agent environments. Powered by blockchain and distributed compute, it enables scalable simulations across AI, gaming, and urban planning. Tokenized incentives drive collaboration within the platform, making it a powerful tool for complex, real-time simulations.

## Features:
- **Multi-Agent Simulation**: Simulate multiple agents interacting in an environment.
- **Scalability**: Leverage decentralized compute to scale simulations.
- **Tokenized Incentives**: Reward users for collaboration and contribution.
